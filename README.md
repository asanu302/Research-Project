# Research-Project
Modelling a Smart Hybrid Bike sharing system using Machine learning 

# Idea and State of art
The idea is to merge these two systems (dockless and Docked station bikes) for analysis and make a new system which has both properties of the system which can be used according to needs of the user and maximum benefits can be made through easy optimization to users and businessperson. The idea was to find a common region which can be classified as maximum and minimum sharing by clustering algorithm k-means and the results was evaluated on the map which deepens the understanding of BSS and gives future scope.

# Working 
The methodology adopted for these project is based on CRISP-DM which works on the assumption that data mining projects follow a predened lifecycle

Data understanding (EDA)
Data Cleaning
Data Modelling
Implementation
Visualisation
